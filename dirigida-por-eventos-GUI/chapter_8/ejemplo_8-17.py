# Entry

'''
The Entry widget is a simple, single-line text input field. 
It is typically used for input
fields in form-like dialogs and anywhere else you need the user to type a value into a
field of a larger display. 
Entry also supports advanced concepts such as scrolling, key
bindings for editing, and text selections

from tkinter import *
from quitter import Quitter

def fetch():
    print('Input => "%s"' % ent.get())             # get text

    # .get() Returns the entry's current text as a string.

root = Tk()

ent = Entry(root)

ent.insert(0, 'Type words here')                   # set text
ent.pack(side=TOP, fill=X)                         # grow horiz

ent.focus()                                        # save a click
ent.bind('<Return>', (lambda event: fetch()))      # on enter key
